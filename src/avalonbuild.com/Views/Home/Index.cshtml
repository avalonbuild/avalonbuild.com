			<h2>What Our Clients Say</h2>

			<li>

				<blockquote>
					<p>As the Committee Chairman of Cutters Run Subdivision in South Barrington I contracted with Avalon.
					John and his company did exceptional work. All the work was done neatly, professionally, and at
					a reasonable price. John Elias is prompt, friendly, easy to work with, and thoroughly competent. I
					recommend him and his company for any level of construction work, whether commercial or residential.</p>
					<cite>Ken D. (South Barrington, IL)</cite>
				</blockquote>

			</li>

			<li>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The entire time we have lived here, I still am amazed and awed by the quality of craftsmanship put into the house. Everyday I still see beauty in the house that previously escaped me. After we moved in, John and his team have worked tirelessly standing behind every detail that needed attention. We have never seen a home built as well and as extraordinary as my house.</p>
					<cite>Mark S. (Ridgefield of Huntley) </cite>
